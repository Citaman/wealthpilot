# UI Revamp Page — Calendar (Bills + Cashflow)

**Version**: v0.17.0

## Why
Calendar is for “what’s coming” + “why did my balance drop”. It must allow drilldowns.

## Goals
- Show bills due + predicted recurring items.
- Click day → see transactions.
- Surface pre-salary low risk.

## UX Requirements
- Month grid with daily spend + bill markers.
- Sidebar panel:
  - upcoming 7/14/30 days
  - quick filters

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clicking a day shows transactions.
- Bills are distinguishable from regular spending.
- Works on mobile (scrollable + sticky controls).
