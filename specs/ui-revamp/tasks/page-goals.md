# UI Revamp Page — Goals

**Version**: v0.17.0

## Why
Goals should feel like planning (bank-grade), not a toy progress bar.

## Goals
- Contribution UX feels real and safe.
- History is visible.
- Optional linkage to an account is understandable.

## UX Requirements
- Goal card:
  - target amount, current, target date
  - progress ring
  - next milestone
- Contribution flow:
  - add contribution (amount, date, note)
  - undo last contribution (optional)
- History:
  - list of contributions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Add contribution updates instantly.
- History is visible and exportable.
- Goal does not break when no target date.
