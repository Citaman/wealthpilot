# UI Revamp Page — Settings & Personalization

**Version**: v0.17.0

## Why
Settings is where trust can be lost. It must be simple, safe, and well-labeled.

## Goals
- Personalization without overwhelm.
- Safety flows (reset/export/import) feel secure.

## Sections
- Appearance: theme (system/light/dark), density
- Budgeting defaults: financial month, income model
- Data: export/import/reset
- Privacy: app lock (if implemented)

## Acceptance Criteria
- No destructive action without clear confirmation.
- Settings changes persist and are reversible.
- Mobile-friendly layout.
