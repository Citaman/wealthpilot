# v0.16.0 — Core Pages Revamp

**Theme**: Make the 5 core flows feel premium: glance → investigate → act.

## Outcomes

- Dashboard becomes a clear “home base”: balances, cashflow, alerts, next actions.
- Transactions become a power tool: search, filter chips, bulk actions, quick edit.
- Budgets become a planner: stable income, allocations, pace, and overrides.
- Analytics becomes drilldown-first and consistent on time ranges.
- Import becomes guided and confidence-based.
