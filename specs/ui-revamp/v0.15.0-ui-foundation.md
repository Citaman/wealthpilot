# v0.15.0 — UI Foundation & System

**Theme**: Make WealthPilot look and feel like one product.

This release creates the UI system that every page will use: consistent spacing, typography, tables/filters, dialogs/drawers, and states.

## Outcomes

- App shell is responsive, polished, and consistent across pages.
- A single **DataTable** + **FilterBar** pattern used everywhere.
- Empty/loading/error states are “designed”, not default.
- Command palette works for core entities.
- Notifications center is real (not mock).

## Tasks

- [Design System & Visual Language](./tasks/design-system-visual-language.md)
- [App Shell & Navigation](./tasks/app-shell-navigation.md)
- [Data Table + Filters System](./tasks/data-table-filters-system.md)
- [Empty/Loading/Error States](./tasks/states-empty-loading-error.md)
- [Command Palette & Search](./tasks/command-palette-search.md)
- [Notifications Center](./tasks/notifications-center.md)

## Definition of Done

- Visual regression spot-check on: dashboard, transactions, analytics, budgets.
- Keyboard navigation passes for shell + table + dialogs.
- Dark mode is controlled by one place and persists.
- At least one end-to-end “search and open transaction” flow works.
